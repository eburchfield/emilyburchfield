Dr. Andrea Rissing is a Postdoctoral Fellow in Environmental Sciences at Emory University. Trained as a cultural anthropologist, she studies drivers of and barriers to making U.S. agriculture more equitable and sustainable. Dr. Rissing's areas of expertise include economic anthropology, environmental studies, critical agrarian studies, political ecology, and sustainable food systems. Her ethnographic scholarship seeks to understand the political, ecological, and historical contexts conducive to positive agrarian change, and she works on interdisciplinary teams to apply these insights on regional scales across diverse US landscapes. In the FACES lab, Dr. Rissing is building on her previous work in the Corn Belt to lead qualitative research on processes of agricultural diversification in the US Southeast.
