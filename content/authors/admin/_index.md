Dr. Burchfield is an Associate Professor in the [Department of Environmental Sciences](http://envs.emory.edu/home/) at Emory University. Her work integrates social and environmental data to support transitions towards more sustainable, resilient, and just agricultural futures. Ongoing projects include (1) modeling the impact of shifting land use on agroecological outcomes, (2) projecting shifts in U.S. cultivation geographies driven by climate change, (3) determining the shared characteristics of productive and resilient agricultural systems, and (4) identifying the multiscalar drivers of farm-level cultivation and conservation behavior. This interdisciplinary research integrates "big" geospatial data with "deep" qualitative and survey data to understand and support agricultural system transition at multiple scales.
