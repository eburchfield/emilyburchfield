Grayson is a junior at Emory University studying Environmental Science and Public Policy Analysis. He is interested in the intersectionality of environmental justice and using geospatial data to analyze disparate impacts of climate change based on socio-economic factors. His work with the FACES Research Group aims to identify how climate change affects different farming communities in the U.S. His other interests include local community-based social change initiatives and ecological restoration work.
