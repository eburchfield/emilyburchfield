Kaitlyn Spangler is a PhD Candidate and Presidential Doctoral Research Fellow in the Environment and Society Department at Utah State University. Her current research seeks to integrate geospatial data and quantitative modeling with the lived experiences of farmers and rural communities in the U.S. and assess the social, political, and ecological tradeoffs of agricultural diversification. Her prior work has utilized in-depth qualitative methodologies to better understand the intersections of household food security, gender, and conservation agricultural practices in both Kenya, Tanzania, and Nepal. Ultimately, she aims to work toward more sustainable and diversified agricultural landscapes and a more just food system at multiple scales. She holds a BA in Anthropology and a BS in Community, Environment, and Development from Penn State (2016) and an MS in Geography from Virginia Tech (2018). Other interests include long-distance running, gardening, and critical conversations over coffee. You can download her CV [here.](Spangler_CV_Summer2020.pdf)
