Dr. Kate Munden-Dixon is a Research Fellow working with Dr. Emily Burchfield and [The Organic Center](https://www.organic-center.org/). She leads a multi-state project to strengthen the organic and agroecological ecosystem across the Southeast by building a community-designed network that connects researchers, Extension and outreach professionals, and farmer-serving organizations. Her work focuses on identifying who is engaged in organic and agroecological research and outreach across the region and developing shared systems that make collaboration easier and more inclusive, with a commitment to ensuring that historically underserved institutions and communities are central to this effort. The overarching goal is to reduce the fragmentation that limits knowledge exchange and resource access, and to lay the groundwork for a community-driven support system so that organic-aligned farmers can benefit from a more collaborative and accessible landscape.
