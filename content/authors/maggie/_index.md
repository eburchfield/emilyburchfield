Maggie is an junior undergraduate majoring in environmental science with a minor in quantitative sciences at Emory University. This past summer, she worked at a greenhouse in Tennessee expanding her own plant knowledge. Her interests are in food and waste management systems. Through mentorship from Dr. Burchfield, Maggie is looking to explore these topics in relation to demographics, transportation, and geography, while gaining insight about geospatial data science.
