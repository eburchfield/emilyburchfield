Marco has a background in economics and statistical sciences. His research examines land-climate interactions from a multidisciplinary perspective, with a particular focus on agricultural ecosystems. He seeks to understand the drivers of anthropogenic land use and land cover changes, and their impacts on climate processes. To explore these dynamics, he employs a wide range of methods, including econometrics for causal inference, spatial statistics, machine learning, and numerical simulations with regional climate models. He uses multiple data sources from different disciplines, ranging from geo-referenced data to economic and climate data, and he has experience in processing large amounts of data using high-performance computing.
