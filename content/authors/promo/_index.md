Dr. Scott Schnur is a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Environmental Sciences at Emory University. Dr. Schnur received his PhD in cultural anthropology, and his work focuses on the intersection of politics, climate change, and the ways that people imagine and work towards equitable environmental futures. His areas of expertise include environmental anthropology, science and technology studies, political ecology, and Arctic studies. After completing his PhD on climate science and politics in Nuuk, Greenland, Dr. Schnur is joining the FACES lab to continue pursuing his interests in human-land relationships and climate futurities. He will spearhead qualitative research across Georgia to better understand how food-system stakeholders understand the barriers and bridges to climate adaptation and agricultural change across the Southeast US.
