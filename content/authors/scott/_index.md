Dr. Schnur is currently a postdoctoral fellow and project manager in the Department of Marine Affairs at the University of Rhode Island. He is a mixed-methods researcher with a background in environmental and social science, and received his PhD from the Department of Anthropology at Emory University in 2022. His work has primarily focused on issues at the nexus of climate change, renewable energy, community engagement, and land use. A former National Geographic explorer, his work has taken him across the US and the Arctic for research, teaching, and speaking. In his time at the FACES lab, Dr. Schnur led [a project](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0743016724000639) exploring the barriers and bridges farmers in Georgia face when implementing their on-farm visions.
