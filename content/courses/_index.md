Here's a list of some of the programming courses I am actively teaching or have taught in the past. In addition to the courses listed below, I also teach courses on environmental economics and sustainable food systems. The FACES team has also put together a "how to grad school" doc that contains our collective knowledge on how to be a good scientist and human being.  You can check out this work in progress [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lxlW_opm_eVCfjn7MW32Wo70Gil7-K1rYOWd5JgxpJU/edit?usp=sharing).
