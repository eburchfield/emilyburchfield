This growing project examines the multidimensional factors that help or hinder farmers as they work to achieve their on-farm goals. It includes engaging with farmers to understand and articulate their vision for their operation, identifying current barriers and bridges to achieving this future vision, and identifying the leverage points (from on-farm constraints to Federal farm policy) to support farmers' efforts to achieve their operational goals.
