## **Undergraduate Students**

Emory undergraduates interested in joining the lab should first take my [Environmental Data Science course](/courses/eds) (ENVS270).  If you feel that you already have the basic skills covered in this course, send me an email with the following:

* Your resume
* A 1-2 page overview of (1) why you want to join the lab, (2) how your research interests align with the projects in the lab, (3) the specific skills you hope to acquire by joining the lab and (4) your plans post-Emory.

## **Graduate Students**

We are thrilled to announce the launch of a new interdisciplinary [PhD program in Environmental Sciences and Society](https://envs.emory.edu/graduate/phd-program.html). The first cohort will start in Fall 2025. This program will center problem-based, applied, interdisciplinary work and will encourage communication and engagement outside of academia.

If you're interested in participating in this program as a member of the FACES lab, contact Dr. B via email and include the following:

* A brief description of your research interests and career goals. If you could design your PhD research from scratch, what would you study? Why?
* Your CV
* Unofficial transcripts
* GRE scores 

Prior experience in GIS, programming, and statistics is strongly recommended for work in the FACES lab, though not required.

## **Postdoctoral Researchers** 

No open positions at the moment. Check back for more soon!
