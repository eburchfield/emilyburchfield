## **Undergraduate Students**

Emory undergraduates interested in joining the lab should first take my [Environmental Data Science course](/courses/eds) (ENVS270).  If you feel that you already have the basic skills covered in this course, send me an email with the following:

* Your resume
* A 1-2 page overview of (1) why you want to join the lab, (2) how your research interests align with the projects in the lab, (3) the specific skills you hope to acquire by joining the lab and (4) your plans post-Emory.

## **Graduate Students**

I welcome applications from students interested in joining the [Department of Environmental Sciences Masters program](http://envs.emory.edu/home/graduate/index.html) at Emory. I strongly recommend you contact me prior to applying for the program. When you contact me, please include the following:

* A brief description of your research interests
* Your CV
* Unofficial transcripts
* GRE scores. 

Prior experience in GIS, programming, and statistics is strongly recommended. 

## **Postdoctoral Researchers** 

We don't have any open positions at the moment.
