abstract: We integrate and analyze agricultural land use and land cover data with policy data to address two main objectives:  first, document and visualize changes over recent decades in cropland conversion, agricultural productivity, and crop composition across the US; and second, identify broad policy changes of the US Farm Bills from 1933 to 2018 associated with these land use trends.
