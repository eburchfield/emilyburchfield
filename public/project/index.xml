      <title>Agricultural Diversity</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Simplification of global landscapes, driven by the expansion and intensification of agriculture, has provided immediate gains for agricultural production, but also degraded beneficial ecosystem processes that support continued agricultural production. There is field-scale evidence of land use diversity&amp;rsquo;s positive impacts on ecosystem health and agricultural production. However, the impacts of land use diversity at landscape scales, at which land use interacts with biophysical phenomena and human activities, is not well understood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our goal is to provide solutions for sustainable agriculture by characterizing how and why landscape simplification affects ecosystem health and agricultural productivity and by identifying barriers to landscape diversification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project is funded by GRANT INFORMATION.  Other folks on the grant are

      <title>Smallholder Adaptation to Drought</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Small-scale farmers in developing countries are among the most vulnerable to climate change. Our research aims to gain a better understanding of how farmers in Sri Lanka, in particular, are adjusting their practices to deal with climate change effects. Since 2010, researchers from Vanderbilt University&amp;rsquo;s Institute for Energy and Environment (VIEE) have partnered with the National Building Research Organization (NBRO) in Sri Lanka to examine the connections between agricultural adaptation and climate change in the dry zone of Sri Lanka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the larger project (Agricultural Decision Making and Adaptation to Precipitation Trends in Sri Lanka or ADAPT-SL), please visit the main project website 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://my.vanderbilt.edu/srilankaproject/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
